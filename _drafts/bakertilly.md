Tech used: wordpress, ftp and css


Goal: to rebuild a broken website 
What i did: 

-created a local install of wordpress in wamp and started the development of the site.
-choose a theme - simone 
-created a child theme to customise the site so it will be the same as the broken site 
-reconstructed the header first
-set up the structure of the site: menu and pages 
-moved the site online so the client could see the work as it developed
-added all the content of the website and styled it - 13 pages
-created a slider for the home page
-customised the footer in footer.php
-finished reconstruction of the site
-added improvements as per request of the client e.g redesign of services page

Result: a wordpress site that is mostly identical to the previous broken one with exception to improvements
