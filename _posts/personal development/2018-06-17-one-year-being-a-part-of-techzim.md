So it's been north of 365 days since I became a part of the team at Techzim and boy has it been a wild and exciting ride. Now, I'd just like to take some time and reflect over the past year and sum up what I've learned so far.

Before we get to the lessons, you might want to listen to the following video to get some context of where I was before I joined Techzim.
