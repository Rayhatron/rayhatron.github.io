Hi, so I've decided to share some thoughts that have been on my mind the past couple of weeks. This isn't anything new and some of you may have probably heard about it but here's my take on the subject of figuring out who you are.

Growing up, my relatives and a lot of people expected me to be a Doctor just like my father or at the very least be something along those lines. At for sometime, when people asked me what I wanted to do for a career, I always answered with 'I want to be a Heart Surgeon'. 

I didn't really know why I even said that at times. However, looking back at it now, I suspect that it was to please people, after all, that answer was close to what they expected and the profession was definitely something most parents would be proud of. 

As time went on and I grew older, I started to discover that I in fact did not want to be that or to do anything in the medical field. I realized along the way that I had buried that inner child in me that got excited by something else. You know if you look back at your childhood and examine the things that peeked your interests, more often than not, you will discover what you really like and sometimes what you'd be happy doing for the rest of your life. 

After all, it is your life and you get to choose what to with it. Yes your situation may be tough but by all means, I indentify that thing that you would do if you didn't have to worry about money and work towards it. You might have to work at a job that you don't like for some time in order to make ends meet but don't let your dreams die. 

Since August 2016, I had been working as a web developer and it's just recently that I changed to a new job where I am writing for an online publication called Techzim. I have never fancied myself the best writer or even thought of writing as a career but then again, I would never know if I had never tried that. 

So now, I spend my days writing articles around technology and business and at night I try buy all means to still fuel that fire in me that likes to write code and build great things. Sometimes, I just manage to read a page of a book but that's better than nothing. 

Here's what I am saying, try out new things, get as many experiences especially if you're still young. I have learnt more about myself in the past 2 weeks that I have been at this job than I have ever in my entire life. Who knows, I might just end up being a writer. 

// Until the next way, take care.
